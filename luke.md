Amos 8:11

G25 agapao

G26 agape, sacrifice into mercy, adultery into prayer, false witness into fasting, pistos,

agapé: love, goodwill

Original Word: ἀγάπη, ης, ἡ

Part of Speech: Noun, Feminine

Usage: love, benevolence, good will, esteem; plur: love-feasts.

26 agápē - properly, love which centers in moral preference. So too in secular ancient Greek, 26 (agápē) focuses on preference; likewise the verb form (25 /agapáō) in antiquity meant "to prefer" (TDNT, 7). In the NT, 26 (agápē) typically refers to divine love (= what God prefers).

Jn 21:15-17,

G25 agapao, jesus death

agapaó: to love

Original Word: ἀγαπάω

Part of Speech: Verb

Usage: I love, wish well to, take pleasure in, long for; denotes the love of reason, esteem.Cognate: 25 agapáō - properly, to prefer, to love; for the believer, preferring to "live through Christ" (1 Jn 4:9,10), i.e. embracing God's will (choosing His choices) and obeying them through His power. 25 (agapáō) preeminently refers to what God prefers as He "is love" (1 Jn 4:8,16). See 26 (agapē).

With the believer, 25 /agapáō ("to love") means actively doing what the Lord prefers, with Him (by His power and direction). True 25 /agapáō ("loving") is always defined by God - a "discriminating affection which involves choice and selection" (WS, 477). 1 Jn 4:8,16,17 for example convey how loving ("preferring," 25 /agapáō) is Christ living His life through the believer.

Perhaps from agan (much); to love, indignation

G5368 phileo, human, lawful

phileó: to love

Original Word: φιλέω

Part of Speech: Verb

Usage: I love (of friendship), regard with affection, cherish; I kiss. 5368 philéō (from 5384 /phílos, "affectionate friendship") - properly, to show warm affection in intimate friendship, characterized by tender, heartfelt consideration and kinship.

From G5384 philos; to be a friend to (fond of (an individual or an object)), i.e. Have affection for (denoting personal attachment, as a matter of sentiment or feeling; while agapao is wider, embracing especially the judgment and the deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty and propriety: the two thus stand related very much as G2309 ethelo and G1014 boulomai, or as G2372 thumos and G3563 nous respectively; the former being chiefly of the heart and the latter of the head); specially, to kiss (as a mark of tenderness) -- kiss, love.

G2309 theló: to will, wish, desire, am willing, intend, design.

Original Word: θέλω

Part of Speech: Verb

wanting what is best (optimal) because someone is ready and willing to act.

2309 /thélō ("to desire, wish") is commonly used of the Lord extending His "best-offer" to the believer - wanting (desiring) to birth His persuasion (faith) in them which also empowers, manifests His presence etc. See 2307 (thelēma).

G1014 boulomai: to will

Original Word: βούλομαι

Part of Speech: Verb

Usage: I will, intend, desire, wish.Cognate: 1014 boúlomai - to plan with full resolve (determination). See 1012 (boulē).

1014 /boúlomai ("resolutely plan") is a strong term that underlines the predetermined (and determined) intention driving the planning (wishing, resolving). In contrast, 2309 (thélō) focuses on the desire ("wishfulness") behind making an offer .

\[While God's "thelō-offers" can be rejected (see 2309 /thélō), His 1014 /boúlomai ("planning") always works out His purpose,

G2372 thumos: passion

Original Word: θυμός, οῦ, ὁ

Part of Speech: Noun, Masculine

Usage: an outburst of passion, wrath.2372 thymós (from thyō, "rush along, getting heated up, breathing violently," cf. J. Thayer) - properly, passion-driven behavior, i.e. actions emerging out of strong impulses (intense emotion).

When 2372 /thymós ("expressed passion") is used of people it indicates rage (personal venting of anger, worth). This flaw is completely absent of the Lord expressing (inspiring) intense anger. Accordingly, 2372 (thymós) is used of God's perfect, holy wrath in Revelation (Rev 14:10,19,15:1, etc.). This anger is directed against sin with intense opposition and without sin.

\[Only the Lord exercises righteous wrath, so we must depend solely on Him as we experience (express) anger.\]

G3563 nous: mind, understanding, reason

Original Word: νοῦς, νοός, νοΐ, νοῦν, ὁ

Part of Speech: Noun, Masculine

Usage: the mind, the reason, the reasoning faculty, intellect.

3563 noús (a masculine noun) - the God-given capacity of each person to think (reason); the mind; mental capacity to exercise reflective thinking. For the believer, 3563 (noús) is the organ of receiving God's thoughts, through faith.

Ro 12:2,3: "2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind (3563 /ólynthos), so that you may prove what the will (2307 /thélēma) of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. 3For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith (4102 /pístis)"

In short, flesh generally relates to unaided human effort, i.e. decisions (actions) that originate from self or are empowered by self.

G4137 pléroó: to make full, to complete

Original Word: πληρόω

Part of Speech: Verb

Usage: I fill, fulfill, complete.Cognate: 4137 plēróō (from plērēs, "be full," see 4130 /plḗthō) - properly, fill to individual capacity, i.e. to the extent it is "meet" (appropriate). See 4130 (plēthō).

From G4134 plérés: full

Original Word: πλήρης, ες

Part of Speech: Adjective

Usage: full, abounding in, complete, completely occupied with.

Cognate: 4134 plḗrēs (an adjective) - full; used of being full of the presence of the Lord (His provisions) which is the definition of a full life. See 4130 (plēthō). Being "full" (4134 /plḗrēs) brings God's wisdom, grace and power (Ac 6:3,8).

From G4130 pletho; replete, or covered over; by analogy, complete -- full.

G4130 : furnish, accomplish, fill, supply

Original Word: πλήθω

Part of Speech: Verb

Usage: I fill, fulfill, complete.

4130 plḗthō (or pimplēmi) - properly, fill to the maximum (full extent), "the limit" (CBL). 4130 /plḗthō ("full") implies "filled to one's (individual) capacity."

\[This root (plē-) expresses totality, and implies full quantity ("up to the max"). DNTT (1,733) notes its cognates (plērēs, plēroō, plērōma) all come from the root (plē-/plēthō) meaning "full in quantity." Thus 4130 /plḗthō ("to fill or complete") refers to "that which is complete in itself because of plentitude, entire number or quantity. . . . the whole aggregate," WS, 395,96).

4130 (plēthō) may be a by-form derived from the same root as pimplēmi. All these terms (cognates) emphasize the idea of "maximum (full extent)."\]
